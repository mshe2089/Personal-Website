# Personal website

Personal dynamic website for portfolio/experimental/learning purposes.

Previously hosted on Heroku until the free tier plan was nuked. **RIP 2021-2022**

Currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4b.

Still a work-in-progress. Visit it at http://muqing.dev/landing

# Hosting

Build and run the production docker containers.

For https, ensure `cert.pem` and  ` ` exist in /etc/ssl

```
docker compose up --build
```

# TODO

Currently:
 - Looking into additional security measures
 - Thinking of features to add
