# Personal website

Self hosted dynamic website for portfolio/experimental/learning purposes.

Down since Heroku's free tier plan was nuked. **RIP 2021-2022**

Still a work-in-progress. Visit it at http://60.242.105.88 (if you dare)

Currently:
 - Reworking the project structure for better extensibility
 - Improving security (reverse proxy, secrets) (please dont hack my pi)
 - Adding a proper frontend framework
 - Working on containerization (docker)
 - Getting it properly hosted (looking for a DNS provider, a cheap domain name, an SSL certificate, etc)
