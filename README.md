# Personal website

Personal dynamic website for portfolio/experimental/learning purposes.

Previously hosted on Heroku until the free tier plan was nuked. **RIP 2021-2022**

Currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4b on my table.

Still a work-in-progress. Visit it at http://muqing.dev/landing (After I'm finished registering the domain)

# Hosting

Build api (flaskr) and client (reactf) images first.

```
docker compose up
```

# TODO

Currently:
 - Looking into additional security measures
 - Getting it properly hosted (looking for a DNS provider, a cheap domain name, an SSL certificate, etc)
 - Thinking of features to add
